Python uses an in-built memory manager that handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically. It uses a private heap to store all Python objects and data structures. The Python Memory Manager allocates memory from this heap, and the Garbage Collector frees memory that is no longer in use by reclaiming objects with zero references. Python also uses techniques like reference counting and generational garbage collection to optimize memory usage."
